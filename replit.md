## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build System**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- Vite as the build tool and development server for fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Wouter for client-side routing (lightweight alternative to React Router)
- Single Page Application (SPA) architecture with client-side navigation

**UI Component Library**
- Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives for accessible, customizable UI elements
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with custom design tokens
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI patterns
- Design system follows "New York" style variant with custom theming

**State Management**
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management, caching, and data fetching
- Local component state using React hooks
- Toast notifications for user feedback

**Styling Strategy**
- Tailwind CSS with custom configuration for design system
- CSS variables for theming (supports light/dark mode)
- Custom color palette based on neutral tones with professional aesthetics
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

**Key Design Decisions**
- Professional services design combining Material Design principles with modern legal/financial platform aesthetics
- Typography system using Inter/DM Sans for primary font, Merriweather/Lora for distinguished content
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind units (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32)
- Component library includes hero slider, services grid, compliance calendar, statistics counter, team profiles, testimonials carousel

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**
- Express.js with TypeScript for RESTful API endpoints
- HTTP server created using Node's native `http` module
- Middleware stack includes JSON parsing, URL encoding, and request logging

**Storage Layer**
- In-memory storage implementation (`MemStorage`) for development
- Interface-based storage design (`IStorage`) allowing easy swap to database implementation
- Currently supports basic user CRUD operations

**API Design**
- RESTful endpoints prefixed with `/api`
- Request/response logging with timing information
- Raw body preservation for webhook handling
- Type-safe request/response handling

**Build & Deployment**
- Separate client and server builds
- Client bundled with Vite, server bundled with esbuild
- Production build creates optimized static assets and single server bundle
- Dependency bundling for critical packages to reduce cold start times

**Development Workflow**
- Vite middleware for development with HMR
- Automatic reload on file changes
- Source maps for debugging
- Development-only features (error overlay, dev banner, cartographer)

### Database Schema

**Current Implementation**
- Uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- Schema defined in `shared/schema.ts` for type sharing between client and server
- Single `users` table with id, username, and password fields
- UUID primary keys generated by database
- Zod schemas for runtime validation

**Migration Strategy**
- Drizzle Kit for schema migrations
- Migration files stored in `./migrations` directory
- Push-based deployment using `db:push` script

**Design Pattern**
- Shared schema types between frontend and backend
- Type inference from database schema to TypeScript types
- Validation schemas derived from database schema using `drizzle-zod`

## External Dependencies

### UI & Component Libraries
- **Radix UI**: Comprehensive set of accessible UI primitives (accordion, alert-dialog, avatar, checkbox, dialog, dropdown-menu, hover-card, label, menubar, navigation-menu, popover, progress, radio-group, scroll-area, select, separator, slider, switch, tabs, toast, tooltip)
- **Embla Carousel**: Touch-friendly carousel for hero slider and testimonials
- **Lucide React**: Icon library for consistent iconography
- **React Icons**: Additional icon set (specifically SiFacebook for social media)

### Form Handling & Validation

- **Zod**: Schema validation for forms and API data
- **zod-validation-error**: Better error messages for validation failures

### Styling & Design
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **class-variance-authority**: Type-safe variant management for components
- **clsx & tailwind-merge**: Conditional class name utilities

### Data Fetching & State
- **TanStack Query**: Async state management, caching, and server synchronization
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation and formatting for compliance calendar

### Database & ORM
- **Drizzle ORM**: TypeScript ORM for PostgreSQL
- **drizzle-zod**: Zod schema generation from Drizzle schemas
- **pg**: PostgreSQL client driver
- **Drizzle Kit**: Schema migration and management tool

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking across the stack
- **ESBuild**: Fast server-side bundling for production
- **Vite Plugins**: Runtime error overlay, development banner, cartographer (Replit-specific)

### Asset Management
- Custom images stored in `attached_assets/generated_images/` for hero slider and team profiles
- Google Fonts integration (Inter, DM Sans, Merriweather, Architects Daughter, Fira Code, Geist Mono)

### Production Considerations
- Session management infrastructure included (connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session store)
- Currently using in-memory storage, designed to swap to PostgreSQL persistence
- Environment variable configuration for database connection
